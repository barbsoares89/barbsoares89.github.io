  desc: >
     Bárbara Soares was born and raised in Brazil, spent a few years in the
     UK as a teenager, and made the move to America on her own at 18 to
     “pursue the dream.” She is an alum of the Florida State University Film
     School and The UCLA MFA Screenwriting program and is currently a staff
     writer on the Apple+ show *Ghostwriter*.

	   Bárbara works in the genre space and loves everything sci-fi, mystery,
	   and supernatural. Her stories always feature strong and diverse female
	   leads and usually tackle questions of identity, culture, and
	   (dis)connection.

	   Growing up in three wildly different countries was the inspiration for
	   much of Bárbara’s work. In Brazil, she wasn’t your standard Brazilian:
	   she couldn’t get a tan to save her life and thought Carnaval was too
	   loud. In England, she was the foreigner who had learned American
	   English and was teased when she called a “rubber” an eraser; in
	   Florida, she was the Latino who didn’t know what a taco was and who
	   watched lots of obscure foreign films but had never seen “E.T.” In
	   short, she never fit into a mold and never really wanted to.

	   Bárbara’s favorite filmmaker is Stanley Kubrick (as you can probably
	   tell from this website). She is represented by Jasper Grey at Vendetta
	   Management and Paul Weitzman at Culture Creative Entertainment.
